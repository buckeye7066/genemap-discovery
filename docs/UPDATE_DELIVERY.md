# Update delivery

Every production web build emits app-update.json with a unique build ID and a numeric bundleVersion. Browser tabs and installed PWAs check on open, return to the foreground, reconnection, and once a minute while visible. Update validates the deployed shell before navigating; Later leaves the update action available. No profile, vault, localStorage, or IndexedDB data is cleared.

This is an in-app notification and an optional local system notification where permission is already granted. It is not server push to a closed application. No APNs, FCM, or Web Push sending service is configured.

GrantFlow and GeneMap publish a checksum-verified OTA archive from the same built identity. Already-installed clients can compare its numeric version even when package.json is unchanged. New native builds embed the same identity. Installation rechecks native compatibility, and incompatible native changes require a signed app release. Older clients without an update checker need one initial signed app update.

Incognito keeps remote web-bundle installation disabled. Android checks the existing public signed-package release channel; Update opens that package and Android asks for installation approval. The release metadata must match the pinned package, host, filename, and established signing certificate. There is no configured Incognito iOS distribution channel.

Tests are build and client regression evidence. Physical-device installation, Safari/iOS behavior, and notifications with the app fully closed require separate device evidence and are not implied by a passing CI run.

GeneMap's Electron desktop package currently loads a bundled file URL, with publish set to null and no updater IPC. Its inspected release channel contains Android artifacts only; no Windows/macOS signing identity is configured in repository secrets. This change does not bootstrap already-installed desktop packages. A trusted desktop installer channel and one initial installer upgrade are required before those packages can receive future updates.

For a native OTA rollback, rebuild the known-good commit to publish a fresh numeric bundle version. Promoting an older immutable web deployment alone does not downgrade native bundles. Native comparisons remain newer-only to avoid replacing a newer signed app with a lagging web deployment; the updater watchdog retains its own failed-boot rollback.
